- Hi, I’m @M-Nikox
- I’m interested in hardware and therefore mainly invested in it aswell, tinkering is very fun and I adore getting to work with microcontrollers and various other types of development kits scattered around the internet.
- I have tried game development in Unity, Godot and Unreal Engine and thoroughly enjoyed it and would like to invest myself deeper into the field.
- I am currently part of a team comprised of colleagues from FCSE developing an educational video game titled "Project C", my role is landscaper, environment and overall game designer.
